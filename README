Application made thanks to android studio.
To use it, branch a Mobile phone using android or
install an Android emulator. Then launch the project on android studio
and run it on the platform you want.


One the app launch you have a menu bar with 2 icons. The first one is a go-back
arrow. It allows you to get back to your last display. For exemple you are on
the about page and you want to go on the one you were before this one, you just
have to click on it. 
The other button is the query icon. Thanks to it we can have access on details
for who did the application and how to contact him.

Then you have two spinners displayed on the screen, the first one is for the
entry currency and the other one for the end currency.
Then you tape the amount you want to convert and then a new pair of rectangle
should appears, the first one is the convertion and the second one the date you
made it.
